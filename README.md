# Cohorts

Cohort analysis: Cohort analysis is a technique that groups customers into cohorts based on a common characteristic or event (such as signup date, first purchase date, etc.) and tracks their behavior over time. Cohort analysis can help understand how different cohorts differ in terms of retention, churn, revenue, etc. and identify factors that influence customer behavior.
